# A151_1IN-6OUTS <br>
<br>
a151extended.lua is an extension of Thorinside's a151.lua file <br>
Instead of having 4 outputs I added 2 more (6OUTS)<br>
It has one input and 6 outputs<br>
I links a signal (one IN) to one of 6 outs with step rotation and reset, <br>
entirely based on the work made by @thorinside <br>
(thank you very much for the help)
